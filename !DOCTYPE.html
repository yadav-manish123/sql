What is a doctype in HTML?
The first line in your HTML code should be the doctype declaration. A doctype tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in.

<!DOCTYPE html>
If you forget to include this line of code in your file, then some of the HTML 5 tags like <article>, < footer >, and <header>  may not be supported by the browser.

What is the HTML root element?
The <html> tag is the top level element of the HTML file. You will nest the <head> and <body> tags inside of it.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
